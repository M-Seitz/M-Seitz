## Hi, I’m @M-Seitz

As a creator of innovative solutions, I am comfortable in extraordinary situations. I am not afraid
of taking on new challenges and I am able to work in a disciplined way on long-term projects.
I prefer to act only after studying a situation in depth. To do so, I do not shy away from difficult
theoretical questions. I like to collect data, formulate hypotheses and solve problems.
In doing so, I am creative, imaginative and passionate. I work very independently, with great
precision and thoroughness. I enjoy genuine human contact. My attitude is marked by dedication
and humanism, perhaps even spirituality.
